# Know Your Style 👗✨



Fashion & clothing data explorations — discovering trends, styles, prices, categories, and more through EDA and open datasets.



## Why this repo?

- Turning curiosity about fashion into data-driven insights.

- Builds on my existing skills: EDA, visualization, classification, anomaly detection, Jupyter notebooks.

- Fun & relatable — "know your style" with numbers behind it!



## Current Notebooks / Work

- [`fashion_products_eda.ipynb`](https://github.com/S33mi/know-your-style/blob/main/notebooks/fashion_products_eda.ipynb) → Exploratory analysis of clothing catalogs (categories, prices, brands, ratings, trends)

- [`fashion_mnist_eda_classification.ipynb`](https://github.com/S33mi/know-your-style/blob/main/notebooks/fashion_mnist_eda_classification.ipynb) → EDA + CNN based classification to classify items (T-shirt, Trouser, Dress, etc.).


More coming soon: style clustering, price vs. rating insights, color trends, recommendation ideas, or "what's trending" summaries.



## Datasets Used / Planned (all free & open)

- [Fashion Clothing Products Catalog (Myntra, ~12k products)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/fashion-clothing-products-catalog)  

  → Great for category/price/brand/rating EDA

- [Fashion Product Images (Small) (~44k items with images & metadata)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small)  

  → Good for basic image + text analysis

- [Fashion MNIST](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zalando-research/fashionmnist)  

  → Currently using for image classification of mutliple fashion items

- Others: Adidas retail products [Adidas Fashion Retail Products](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/adidas-fashion-retail-products-dataset-9300-prod) 1.5K Adidas products (price, availability, color, rating), clothing sales datasets, etc.
